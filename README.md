## Summary

<summary><b>Ex00 - BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ </b></summary>
    <p> The goal of this exercise is to create a class (Zombie) and then create objects of this class, allocating memory on the stack or on the heap using <b>new</b>. With this, we should understand that objects created on the stack are only available within the scope in which they were created. On the other hand, objects created on the heap can be used outside of the scope where they were created.
    In the case where memory is being allocated on the <b>heap</b>, we need to use delete at the end of the program execution to avoid <b>memory leaks</b>.
    </p>
